    "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).AIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV)). It is one of the most dangerous virus that is threatening human beings' lives, not only adults but also children. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this report I will investigate a few HIV datasets which are downloaded from [Gapmind](http://www.gapminder.org/data/). The datasets are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Child-HIV .csv:** Child death rate in year 2008 in different countries, per thousand\n",
    "* **1-59-HIV .csv:** Total number of child death in year 2008 in different countries\n",
    "* **indicator_hiv_plwha.csv:** Total number of HIV livings in different years and countries \n",
    "* **Indicator_Estimated new HIV cases All ages.csv:** Total number of people among all age groups that were newly infected with HIV during different years\n",
    "* **Indicator_HIV Incidence Ages 15-49.csv:** Number of people between 15 and 49 years old that were newly infected with HIV during the given year per 100 population\n",
    "* **Indicator_Annual number of AIDS deaths.csv:** Total number of deaths due to AIDS during different years\n",
    "* **indicator hiv estimated prevalence% 15-49.csv:** Number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I would also feel interested in continent-wise distribution of different variables, so I need an additional data source to translate from countries to continents. I am using [this dataset](https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes/blob/master/all/all.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "I am hoping to answer a few questions from data in hand: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Which country is the most dangerous in terms of the number of people infected and death percentage. \n",
    "* What's the trends over time of this top country."

In the countries of sub-Saharan Africa most affected, AIDS has raised death rates and lowered life expectancy among adults between the ages of 20 and 49 by about twenty years. Furthermore, the life expectancy in many parts of Africa is declining, largely as a result of the HIV/AIDS epidemic with life-expectancy in some countries reaching as low as thirty-four years.\n",
